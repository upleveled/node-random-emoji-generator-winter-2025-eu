# Node.js Random Emoji Generator

Display a random emoji by running the application without any arguments:

```
node index.js
ðŸ™Œ
node index.js
ðŸ˜…
```

Display a specific emoji by providing the emoji name as argument:

```
node index.js smiley
ðŸ˜€
```

Display an error message if the emoji name is incorrect:

```
node index.js UpLeveled
This emoji UpLeveled doesn't exist
```
